# Third-Party Source Notices

## codex-proxy-rs

Source: https://github.com/ANRCM0/codex-proxy-rs
Fixed revision: 591f95cc18ce95eb6fc87cf46a3526c5b3ecba36.
Original file: backend/crates/gateway-protocol/src/openai/events.rs.
Original functions: billable_usage_is_complete, number_field and nested_number_field.

The checked token-bound arithmetic in
internal/foundation/contracts/execution/v3/validation.go is adapted from that
function under Apache License 2.0. The included
[license copy](licenses/codex-proxy-rs-Apache-2.0.txt) reproduces the upstream
license. The referenced source has no file-specific copyright or SPDX notice;
the fixed upstream root contains no NOTICE file.

Modifications: Rust-to-Go adaptation, optional nonnegative int64 counts instead
of default-zero u64 values, explicit provenance/completeness validation, unknown
totals preserved, no inferred totals, reasoning-output parent bounds and known
child lower bounds for partial totals. This
notice applies to the identified adaptation; it does not license all TXAPI code
or imply endorsement by the upstream project.

The optional integer field lookup in nestedNativeCount in
internal/protocol/responses/usage_envelope.go adapts number_field and
nested_number_field under the same Apache License 2.0. Changes: Go JSON raw
messages and exact native field lookup, optional int64 rather than default-zero
u64, strict rejection of invalid known field types, and missing/null preserved
as unknown. Existing SSE framing and other protocol functions are TXAPI code;
this adaptation does not change their licensing.

sub2api's explicit-zero field precedence informed a regression scenario only.
No sub2api implementation or additional dependency is copied by this batch.

## codex-proxy-rs Account Authorization Mechanics

The R04a operator account tool also adapts selected mechanics from the same
fixed revision 591f95cc18ce95eb6fc87cf46a3526c5b3ecba36 (Apache License 2.0):

- `backend/crates/providers/openai/src/credential/oauth.rs`: random secrets,
  S256 challenge derivation, callback parameter uniqueness and constant-time
  state comparison, adapted in `internal/protocol/openaiauth/provider.go`.
- `backend/crates/providers/openai/src/credential/token_client.rs`: bounded
  form token exchange and fixed failure categories, adapted across the pure
  provider and the existing core-backed HTTP caller.
- `backend/crates/gateway-core/src/provider_ports/refresh.rs`: stable jitter
  and bounded backoff, adapted in `internal/store/upstream_accounts.go` only
  for proved not-dispatched refreshes.

Repository/refresh ownership in the reference informed the claim/CAS design;
TXAPI uses its existing SQLite runner and credential AEAD vault instead of
the reference's database stack. The implementation uses the current documented
dynamic registration and issued-client binding, verifies OIDC signatures and
identity, and never logs token material or retries ambiguous rotating-token
refreshes. This is an operator authorization tool, not an inference adapter.
The included license copy remains applicable; the fixed reference has no root
NOTICE. Other TXAPI code retains its existing licensing.
